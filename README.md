# FamApp - AI-Powered Family Travel Coordinator

## 🚀 Live Demo
Visit [FamApp](https://famapp.vercel.app) to experience the future of family travel planning.

## The Problem We're Solving

**Family travel coordination is broken.** Current travel apps assume one person with one set of preferences planning for themselves. But family travel is about managing competing needs, constraints, and personalities simultaneously.

### The Real Story
During a family trip to Spain (multi-generational group: mid-30s parents with 14-month-old, mid-60s grandparents, 80-year-old great-grandparents, mid-20s uncle), we watched one person become the **unpaid travel coordinator** for the entire group. She had to:

- Navigate 80-year-old grandparents' mobility needs
- Handle dietary restrictions and allergies  
- Find kid-friendly options for a toddler
- Coordinate preferences across 3 generations
- Manage logistics while bride/groom focused on wedding planning
- Make real-time decisions with incomplete information

**The overwhelmed family coordinator shouldn't exist.** Travel agents were important in the past - why not leverage AI to do that now?

## Our Vision

**FamApp will become the world's first AI-powered family travel coordinator** - an intelligent assistant that knows every family member's needs, preferences, constraints, and schedules.

### Future AI Experience:
*"I see you have 3 hours free Monday. Based on your group (80-year-old grandparents, 14-month-old, gluten allergy), here are 3 restaurants within 2 blocks that have high chairs, wheelchair access, and gluten-free options. Shall I make a reservation for 6 people at 12:30?"*
