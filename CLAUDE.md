# FamApp Development Todo List
**Generated: July 18, 2025**

## Phase 1: ML Foundation & Smart Task Enhancement

### âœ… COMPLETED TASKS
- Fix mobile CRUD operations (activities, travel, packing)
- Build mobile-first forms for all trip components  
- Implement smart task generation system (SmartTaskGenerator.ts)
- Create destination-based task intelligence
- Add family composition task intelligence
- Integrate smart tasks into trip creation flow

### ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Phase 1 Core
1. **Update trip wizard to include opt-in dietary preferences section**
   - Add privacy-first approach for sensitive data collection
   - Implement opt-in checkbox for dietary preferences
   - Update TripWizard.tsx preferences step

2. **Add simple weather API calls to SmartTaskGenerator (7Timer)**
   - Integrate 7Timer API (no auth required)
   - Generate weather-based tasks: "Pack umbrella - rain expected Dec 15th"
   - Simple fetch calls, no complex caching yet

3. **Add simple holiday API calls to SmartTaskGenerator (Nager.Date)**
   - Integrate Nager.Date API (no auth required)  
   - Generate holiday-based tasks: "Expect crowds - Christmas week in Madrid"
   - Check destination holidays during travel dates

4. **Add simple country data API calls to SmartTaskGenerator (REST Countries)**
   - Integrate REST Countries API (no auth required)
   - Generate country-specific tasks: "Get power adapter for Type C outlets"
   - Add visa, currency, cultural information

5. **Enhance SmartTaskGenerator with family dynamics intelligence rules**
   - Priority focus: Real family pain points
   - Examples: "Skip Louvre with kids under 8 - try MusÃ©e d'Orsay instead"
   - Age-appropriate activity suggestions
   - Family logistics and timing advice

### âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Enhancement & Validation
6. **Build synthetic data generation script (10k family scenarios)**
   - Generate realistic family profiles and trip combinations
   - Test AI task generation across diverse scenarios
   - Output: CSV files for analysis
   - Weight: 60% common families, 40% edge cases

7. **Test enhanced AI task generation with real trip scenarios**
   - Validate suggestions make sense across family types
   - Ensure task relevance and quality
   - Test with different destinations, dates, family compositions

8. **Add error handling for API failures (graceful degradation)**
   - Handle API downtime gracefully
   - Fall back to static/cached data when APIs fail
   - Never break core trip planning experience

### ðŸ“Š LOW PRIORITY - Analysis Tools  
9. **Create CSV export functionality for synthetic data analysis**
   - Export generated scenarios and tasks
   - Enable data analysis in Excel/Google Sheets
   - Support future pattern recognition work

## Future Phases (Not in scope for Phase 1)
- **Phase 2**: Feedback collection systems (pre/during/post trip)
- **Phase 3**: Pattern recognition and behavioral analysis
- **Phase 4**: Advanced ML (recommendation engine, predictive modeling)

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Storage**: SQLite with abstraction layer for future migration
- **Caching**: Tiered approach (weather: 6hrs, holidays: 30 days, countries: 7 days)
- **Privacy**: No personal/health data collection initially, opt-in for dietary
- **APIs**: Start with no-auth APIs only (7Timer, Nager.Date, REST Countries)
- **Implementation**: Simple approach first, proper infrastructure later

## Key Focus Areas
1. **Family Dynamics Intelligence** - Highest value for families
2. **Real Pain Points** - Address actual family travel challenges
3. **Privacy First** - Careful with sensitive data collection
4. **Simple Start** - Prove value before building complex infrastructure
